Most of the code is written by me, based on reverse-engineering Noita or a few mods. Whenever I use code directly from someone else, I credit the original creators here.

Conga Lyne - Writing most of the code of Apotheosis wich I use as a guide line
Evasia - Creating the item list appends script
Copis - Extracting liquid from potion (use for stone_tp)
Lamia - Translation insert script
